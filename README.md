# Arena (Atomic Reconstruction of RNA)

Arena is a stand-alone program used for the full-atomic reconstruction of RNA structures from coarse-grained models. Arena can build in full-atomic detail for any residue with at least one heavy atom (of any identity). Arena takes an input in PDB format and first fills in the missing heavy atoms via superimposition. Arena iterates through three refinement steps to correct bond lengths and angles, correct base and base pair conformations, and remove atomic clashes. Structures generated by Arena are highly accurate in terms of RMSD (< 3.7 Ã… on average), contain almost no clashes, and run in < 3.5 sec on average. The runtime will depend on the length of your RNA; the longest RNA we tested was 692 nt and ran in < 35 sec. Arena can be downloaded from here and run on your local computer or you can use the [webserver](https://zhanggroup.org/Arena/). We have provided example PDB structures to run with Arena in the "Examples" folder.

## Installation

Download Arena from GitHub into your desired location, such as your Desktop:
```
git clone https://github.com/pylelab/Arena.git
```

In the new Arena folder, compile with Clang:
```
cd Arena
make Arena
```

## Usage

Run Arena using one of the provided examples:
```
./Arena Examples/5osg2.input.pdb Examples/5osg2.output.pdb 5
```

To see the help menu:
```
./Arena
```
Note: If the RNA is interacting with other molecules (proteins, ligands, etc), the user must manually remove the non-RNA chains for the Arena standalone program. Arena can, however, handle multichain RNA inputs without user intervention (see below). On the other hand, [the Arena webserver](https://zhanggroup.org/Arena/) automatically excludes non-RNA residues.

## Special Case: Multiple Models

Split into separate model files, run Arena on individual models, and combine the output into one structure:
```
python3 split_models.py Examples/2koc.pdb Examples/2koc.output.pdb
```

## Benchmarking Scripts

Calculate root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD):
```
python calculate_RMSD.py -r Examples/5osg2.pdb -i Examples/5osg2.output.pdb
```

Calculate interaction network fidelity (INF):
Note: the PDB files must be within the example directory of [RNA_assessment](https://github.com/RNA-Puzzles/RNA_assessment/tree/master): 
```
python RNA_assessment/INF.py example/5osg2.pdb 5osg2.index example/5osg2.output.pdb 5osg2.index
```

Calculate number of clashes:
```
make Arena_counter
./Arena_counter Examples/5osg2.output.pdb Examples/5osg2.clashes.txt 5
```

Calculate mean absolute error (MAE):
```
python calculate_MAE.py -r Examples/5osg2.pdb -i Examples/5osg2.output.pdb
```
